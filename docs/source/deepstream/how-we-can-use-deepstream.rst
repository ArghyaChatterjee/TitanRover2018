How we can use Deepstream
=========================

For the Controls Team, we can take advantage of using Deepstream by allowing multiple components to update the data store independently of each

must be able to have a network connection, however, this can be remedied by adding a network hat or some other solution. 

Here's an example configuration of a potential system layout:
