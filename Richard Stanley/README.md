# Projects for the 2018 Titan Rover

Each folder is a project idea that may or may not come to fruition on the 2018 Titan Rover project.  I'm trying to document as much as I can, and provide links to software, or readable material for those specific ideas.  If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or interest in these ideas, please feel free to [contact me on slack](https://titanrover.slack.com/messages/@audstanley/) directly or message us in the [controls channel](https://titanrover.slack.com/messages/C6YHJHY02/). **Get involved, don't wait.**
